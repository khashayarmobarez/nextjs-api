# Next.js API Routes

This project demonstrates how to create and use API routes with Next.js.

* **API Routes:**
    * `GET`: Retrieve data.
    * `POST`: Create new data.
    * `PUT`: Update existing data.
    * `DELETE`: Remove data.
    * `PATCH`: Partially update data.
    
* **File System Routing:**
    * Create API endpoints by placing files in the `pages/api` directory.

* **Middleware:**
    * Run code before a request is completed.  Useful for authentication.

* **Environment Variables:**
    * Store sensitive data securely.  Use `process.env`.

* **Error Handling:**
    * Implement robust error handling for API requests.  Use `try...catch` blocks.

* **Authentication and Authorization:**
    * Secure API routes with authentication strategies, like JWT or OAuth.

* **Database Integrations:**
    * Connect to databases (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) and manage data.



* **project and api explanation**
    all the examples are used inside the project
    the data base is in the file and is fake, the database project uses real database(mongodb)
    for dynamic routes you should act the same way you did with dynamic pages in nextjs
    all the methods examples are set in the project
